# tic-tac-toe
I am trying to develop a game as per the Instructions in the Javascript course by The Odin Project.
I am a beginner and I am trying to learn programming for the first time, so there will be silly mistakes in this project,
Kindly bear with me. 
I am open to suggestions and critique so kinf=dly help me develop my Programming skills by providing your valuable inputs.

Thanks, Enjoy!
